    I would say that Batima bricks are very unknown and mysterious, as many of their properties are unknown -- Were they first manufactured in 1880, 1900, 1905, or 1923? Were they first manufactured in Brussels, somewhere else in Belgium, or a completely different country? Who was the first manufacturer? Were there different types and/or "phases" of Batima bricks? Are they made out of card or "milk-curd" plastics? Well, I have ordered a whopping 3 Batima bricks (a lot, I know) to find out. When I receive them, I will post pictures here. The seller was kind enough to add some "specials" for free, so I'll post pictures of those as well. So, that's all for now.
