  <a href="https://retro-person.github.io/index.html">Back</a></br>The history of interlocking building blocks goes back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first known interlocking brick, the Belgian "milk curd" (material) brick <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/batima.html">Batima</a>, was invented in either 1880 or 1905, and was <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/FR588985A/en?q=A63H33%2f088&assignee=batima">supposedly patented in 1924</a>. The Irish wooden <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/dometo.html">Dometo</a> and <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/villeto.html">Villeto</a> bricks soon followed. The next interlocking brick known to me was the rubber, "silent and safe" <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/bildobri.html">Bild-O-Brik</a> (not to be the confused with the <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/bildbrik.html">Bild-a-Brik</a>) produced by the American Erector company from 1934 to the 1950s. In 1935, <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/minibrix.html">Minibrix</a> came out, a very similar rubber brick. Then came the 1939 <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/ambricks.html">American Brick</a>, initially made out of wood. Also in 1939 was Kiddicraft's first venture into the interlocking brick market, the Bri-Plax Interlocking building cube. Then, we jump to 1946, when the plastic version of the American Brick is first produced -- ironically in cooperation with the ELGO -- yes, ELGO -- company. Then came Kiddicraft's <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/kiddicra.html">Self-Locking Bricks</a> in 1947. Finally, we come to LEGO's first brick, the 1949 <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toypages/lego.html">Automatic Binding Brick</a>, an almost identical clone of the Kiddicraft's previous brick. I will not venture into bricks past this point, since most of them were similar to LEGO or its direct clones. However, many more building blocks, and most of the ones mentioned here, are documented at <a href="http://www.architoys.net/toys/toylist1.html">http://www.architoys.net/</a>.
