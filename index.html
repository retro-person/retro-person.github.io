<h1>RedirectionSection (tm)</h1>
<h2>How this works</h2>
So, if, anywhere on any of my GitHub repositories, there is a link, it probably links to here in square brackets with a
number. This is an ID number. In the LinkList (tm) section below, you will see a link with a number next to it. Use the
ID number you recieved on GitHub to see its corresponding link. Then, copy and paste the link. That's it! This is just
to make all of the links more secure.
